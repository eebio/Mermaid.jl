# Mermaid.jl

Mermaid.jl is a general purpose component-based simulation tool in Julia.
It allows users to connect arbitrary Julia models from a wide range of packages to produce complex coupled simulations.

* Any simulation that can be performed in Julia can be included as a component, from DifferentialEquations.jl, to Agents.jl and beyond.
* Simple interface for extending components to tools not yet supported.
